### Problem Statement

- Atliq Grands are losing its market share and revenue in the luxury/business hotels category.
- Due to strategic moves from other competitors and ineffective decision-making in management.
- As a strategic move, the managing director of Atliq Grands wanted to incorporate “Business and Data Intelligence” in order to regain their market share and revenue.
- However, they do not have an in-house data analytics team to provide them with these insights.
- Their revenue management team had decided to hire a 3rd party service provider to provide them insights from their historical data.

### My role in this project

- Hi, I’m Spiros, a new data analyst at AtliQ Grand.
- I recently joined the company and briefed about the task in the stakeholder business review meeting.
- Today, I'm excited to discuss the role I'll be building a dashboard to address the Hospitality Revenue challenges.

### Our goal

- Regain their market share in the luxury/business hotels category.
- Understanding the revenue trend by week/month/day
- To get insights where business is failing and what can be done to tackle them

### Business Matrices Used


1. **Average Daily Rate (ADR)**: ADR signifies the average price charged for each room per day. It's computed by dividing the total room revenue by the number of rooms sold.
2. **Occupancy Percentage (%)**: This metric calculates the ratio of occupied rooms to the total available rooms, serving as a critical performance indicator.
3. **Revenue**: Revenue encompasses the total income generated by the hotel, including earnings from room bookings, dining services, and events.
4. **RevPAR (Revenue per Available Room)**: RevPAR represents the revenue generated per available room, whether occupied or not. It aids hotels in assessing their revenue-generating performance for accurate room pricing. RevPAR also enables comparisons with other properties or brands.
5. **Average Rating**: The average rating is the mean score or rating given by guests based on their stay experience, often sourced from guest reviews and surveys.
6. **No Show Rate (%)**: This metric reveals the percentage of guests who make reservations but do not arrive at the hotel as scheduled.
7. **Daily Booked Room Night (DBRN)**: DBRN indicates, on average, how many rooms are booked for a specific day within a given timeframe.
8. **Daily Sellable Room Night (DSRN)**: DSRN represents, on average, how many rooms are available for sale on a particular day within a specified period.
9. **Daily Utilized Room Night (DURN)**: DURN denotes, on average, how many rooms are effectively utilized by customers for a given day during a specific timeframe.
10.   **Realization (%)**: Realization is the percentage of successfully "checked-out" bookings out of all the reservations made. The comprehension and tracking of these metrics are crucial for a hotel's success, as they contribute significantly to pricing optimization, resource allocation, and the improvement of overall guest satisfaction in hotel management.

### Learned things from this project

- By referring different cancellation polices followed by different hotels, understood that most of the hotels charge zero fee, only if the booking is cancelled before three months of booking date. If the booking is cancelled after that, the charge range from 60 to 90% of the booking cost.
- Visualization methods to enhance report creation.
- I learned about telling data-driven stories with this beautiful dashboard.
- Understanding the business requirements based on the data.

### Insights

#### Realisation and ADR by platform

![Realisation Logo](https://github.com/anteportas2023/AtliQ_Hospitality_Analysis/blob/main/Resources/Realisation%20%25%20and%20ADR.png)

- The realization rates across these platforms are quite consistent, showing that they convert bookings into revenue at similar rates, around 70%. However, the Average Daily Rates (ADR) vary slightly, with Direct Offline and Others having the highest ADR at $12,794.
- Focusing on improving conversion rates might be beneficial for platforms like Tripster and Others, while high ADR platforms should aim for competitive pricing alongside achieving better conversion rates.

#### % Revenue by Category

![Revenue by Category](https://github.com/anteportas2023/AtliQ_Hospitality_Analysis/blob/main/Resources/%25%20Revenue%20by%20Category.png)

- The luxury category generates 61.62% of the total revenue, while the business category contributes 38.38%. This suggests a higher customer preference for luxury experiences, showing a stronger demand for upscale amenities.
- Despite contributing a substantial share, the business category indicates a slightly lower preference compared to luxury offerings in the hospitality

### Trend by Key Metrics(RevPar, ADR, Occupancy%)

![Trend by Key Metrics](https://github.com/anteportas2023/AtliQ_Hospitality_Analysis/blob/main/Resources/Trend%20by%20Key%20Metrics.png)

- **RevPAR Trend**: Fluctuates across weeks, peaking at W19, W20, W24, W27, W28, W29 indicating higher revenue per available room.
- **ADR Stability**: ADR remains steady around 12,700 with minor fluctuations.
- **Occupancy Pattern**: Shows recurring peaks and valleys, correlating with RevPAR peaks, suggesting a link between higher room occupancy and increased revenue.
- **Overall**: Stable ADR, periodic peaks in RevPAR and occupancy rates, hinting at a connection between higher rates, occupancy, and revenue per room.

### Properties by Key Metrics
